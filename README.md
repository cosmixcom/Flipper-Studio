# Flipper Studio

Flipper Studio is a simple-to-use IDE for all Flipper-related software. Currently, Flipper Studio supports the use of Flipper Zero CLI, the design of BadUSB/BadBT apps using Rubber Ducky 1.0, and the creation of Flipper Zero Applications.

## Features

- Access Flipper Zero CLI
- Boots BadUSB files directly to device via serial port
- File imports
- Integrated AI For BadUSB (ctrl + i)

## Roadmap

### App Building
While you can currently design apps for Flipper devices with our Native App feature, you cannot build them for the Flipper directly.

### CLI Tools
A more immersive CLI experience that provides custom Flipper Studio commands, for terminal-like features, and the ability to run scripts which execute more than one command.
